Timer clock - remove seconds? (performance based on different laptop. mine poor performance therefore could not update per seconds)

Scan Pass - the clickable indication appears for the whole row but its only clickable at the "card"

counter.js

- Ln 41 => currently its task.delegate is it supposed to be task.id ?
- Ln 111 => name is empty so it will return false and could not go in IF statement.

Scanned - Patient name: abc => <strong>Patient Name:<strong> abc (aesthetic POV)

Instructions

- when Help is clicked and exited from help, the Exit button no longer working unless going to the
  next page to reactive the exit button.

- my laptop need to scroll down, to read all. the EXIT and HELP will follow but could not be click if its scrolled down
