# Counter

## Timer clock

- remove seconds? (performance based on different laptop. mine poor performance therefore could not update per seconds)
<!-- Ignored, i'm calling every 5 seconds -->

## Scan Pass

- the clickable indication appears for the whole row but its only clickable at the "card"
  **Fixed**

## counter.js

- Ln 111 => name is empty so it will return false and could not go in IF statement to update the inventory DB
  **Fixed**

## Instructions

- when Help is clicked and exited from help, the Exit button no longer working unless going to the
  next page to reactive the exit button.
  <!-- Cannot replicate -->

- my laptop need to scroll down, to read all. the EXIT and HELP will follow but could not be click if its scrolled down
  **I changed laptop scaling from 125% (Windows recommandation) to 100% then dont have scrolling already.**
